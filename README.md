## Problem statement:
~~~
"The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. 
You are required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
- 1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
- 2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
- 3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
- 4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers."

## Assignment: [numpy-random.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/numpy-random/blob/main/numpy-random.ipynb)

### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 
Jupyter can also be installed separately from its website.

### Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.
### How do run/save this jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as numpy-random.ipynb (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open CMDER and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the numpy-random.ipynb
- Open file.
